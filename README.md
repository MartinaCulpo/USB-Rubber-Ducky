# USB-Rubber-Ducky
A Python-Based Emulator for Keystroke Injection and Liveness Detection Research

Overview

Keystroke dynamics offer a promising way to distinguish genuine human typing from potentially harmful automated activity. This project investigates keystroke injection attacks by mimicking human-like behavior using pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
The central part is a Python-based USB Rubber Ducky emulator that simulates keystroke sequences with realistic timing, following commands in a Ducky Script-like syntax. These synthetic sequences are evaluated by training various classifiers to detect machine input and testing their robustness against adversarial examples.



Objectives
- Emulate keystroke injection attacks with realistic delays and jitter
- Train machine learning classifiers to distinguish machine vs. human typing
- Use GANs to produce adversarial input that mimics human behavior
- Evaluate the resilience of keystroke-based liveness detection systems



Features
- USB Rubber Ducky emulator with customizable typing behavior
- Ducky Script-style commands
- 4 PRNG options for timing randomness: Philox, Xoroshiro128, Mersenne Twister, PCG64
- Real human keystroke dataset integration
- ML classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, k-NN
- GAN-based input generation for adversarial robustness testing



Research Impact

This work demonstrates that standard classifiers are effective at spotting naive injection attacksâ€”but are vulnerable to adversarial imitation via GANs. It highlights the need for robust liveness detection methods capable of withstanding generative attacks in keystroke-based security systems.
