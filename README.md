# USB-Rubber-Ducky
A Python-Based Emulator for Keystroke Injection and Liveness Detection Research

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Keystroke dynamics offer a promising way to distinguish genuine human typing from potentially harmful automated activity. This project investigates keystroke injection attacks by mimicking human-like behavior using pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
